For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or captivating sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the captivating sensation we had both been expecting.
